## Challenge Description

- In the real world, a man has a mouth. His mouth can do operations like open/close at the man's will. Another man cannot force a man to do such operations without the man's permission. For example, a doctor can examine his mouth and request him to do such operations and he will follow the doctor's requests after confirming the doctor's identity. For others, he doesn't want them to do such operations. Use OOP Designs to make needed classes with methods to meet those requirements. You can use any language or pseudo- code to write down your results.
